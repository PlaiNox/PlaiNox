404580,Relive,"Oct 15, 2015",50000 - 100000,0,0,0.0,0,"Relive is a game about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it is also an adventure game. The main purpose is to increase the awareness about this topic and push people, especially teenagers and young adults, to take a CPR classes and be prepared to intervene in case of need. While the topic is serious, we tried to create a fun and entertaining game, a SCI-FI opera where players can enjoy their gaming experience while the CPR concept slips through the game. To move forward in the story and complete successfully Relive, you will need to learn the bases of CPR, in an interesting and non-invasive way. To keep the CPR skills razor sharp a tournament mode encourages group play. Family, schools and friends will be able to organize fast and fun CPR challenges and see who will be able to beat the best score. Why CPR? In Europe every day 1.000 people die of cardiac arrest. If immediate CPR is performed, the chances of survival remarkably increase. In more than 70% of instances, cardiac arrest is witnessed and CPR could be initiated by bystanders. As of today, in Europe only in 15% of cases witnesses perform CPR (European average). Taking a CPR class is the best way to rise this 15% of bystanders and save lives with no additional risk. Is Relive really free? Yes, Relive is completely free. The development of this game was made possible thanks to Future of Health Award, which purpose is to “bring serious gaming and healthcare together in order to contribute to more advanced healthcare across Europe“.

1369370,Combat Mission Shock Force 2,"Aug 31, 2020",0 - 20000,25,0,59.99,3,"The latest title in the famous Combat Mission franchise of wargames, now on Steam. Shock Force 2 brings you to a hypothetical conflict in Syria between the forces of NATO and the Syrian Army. Take command of US Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) to fight against Syrian Army Infantry, Mechanized and Armored units in an arid setting. Experience the full range of modern threats to conventional military forces, including irregular combat forces, terrorists, spies, suicide bombers, IED's and other deadly tools employed in the asymmetric warfare of the modern day. Play the Task Force Thunder campaign, more than a dozen carefully crafted battles, or unlimited Quick Battles. HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED Players are assigned detailed missions to accomplish based on a richly diverse set of Objectives. Missions can be played in either Real Time or our WeGo hybrid turn based mode introduced with the first Combat Mission game 20 years ago. WeGo allows each player to plan out 60 seconds of combat and then watch as both sides' commands are carried out simultaneously. The WeGo system also allows for re-watching turn action and playing against another player by email (PBEM) or 'hotseat' on a single computer. RealTime and WeGo head to head play can also use TCP/IP on a LAN or over the Internet. Massive replayability comes from a unique Quick Battle system which allows players to purchase their own custom force and fight over the battlefield of their choice from a wide array of different maps. A powerful map and scenario Editor allows you to create battles or campaigns for yourself and others. HOW UNITS ARE PORTRAYED All units are portrayed one for one in 1:1 scale in high resolution polygon 3D models with articulated suspensions, animated hatches, and other features that make them feel real. Unlike other 3D tactical wargames, Combat Mission combines real world physics with a thoroughly researched portrayal of forces, right down to what the individual soldiers cary into battle. Advanced vehicle damage modeling allows for tracking of each sub-system, including the most realistic ballistics, armor and post-armor effects available in any game. Unlike other games that claim this level of realism, Combat Mission actually delivers it across the whole spectrum of warfare, including the interaction of weather, lighting, and terrain on how units and their weapons function.  Perhaps the most important feature of Combat Mission is its detailed and innovative portrayal of 'soft factors'. Experience, Morale, Leadership, and other elements operate at the individual soldier level and collectively transform how units behave. As important as these battlefield concerns are, most other games give them short shrift or don't bother covering them at all. In the real world having the best weapons means nothing if the soldiers crewing them are balled up in fear or are too distracted to see what's going on around them. HOW THINGS WORK BEHIND THE SCENES Weapon penetration values and armor protection are based on extremely detailed real life data and scientific algorithms that are specific to exactly what is seen in the game. There are no arbitrary values (hitpoints) or precalculated resolution tables (CRTs) that so often produce frustratingly inaccurate results. The advanced Tactical AI (TacAI) models the psychological state and inherent qualities of every soldier on the battlefield, allowing for genuine battlefield behavior from every soldier as if they were their own free thinking individual.  The simulation of independent soldiers is important in another regard because it allows Combat Mission to have what we call Relative Spotting. This is a system which ensures that each soldier has their own unique view of the battlefield, avoiding the 'Borg' issue seen in many games where once one person has spotted an enemy, automatically everyone else has spotted it and can fire on it as well. Any wargamer worth his weight in gunpowder knows that Fog of War is one of the most important battlefield elements. An unprecedented simulation of Command and Control (C2) combines with Relative Spotting to realistically portray the flow of information and responsibility between soldiers as they share information with each other on what they can see on the battlefield  All of these elements, and many more, seamlessly fit together to create the most realistic battlefield experience out there. The realism level isn't pushed in your face with lots of data and obscure references. Instead players experience all of this with the 3D graphical environment. Combat Mission's visceral game environment is what attracts players, the richness of the gameplay is what keeps them playing for years on end. Features: - Tactical warfare at battalion and below scale in a true 3D environment - Command individual vehicles, teams, and squads - Expansive simulation of 'soft factors' such as Morale, Experience, and Leadership - Innovative systems portraying Fog of War, Spotting, Line of Sight, Command &amp; Control, and Objectives - Unmatched realistic physics, ballistics, and battlefield effects - Fight in a wide range of weather and lighting conditions, all of which realistically impact fighting abilities - Unique hybrid system for RealTime or WeGo (turn based) play - Full featured Editor for maps, scenarios, and campaigns - Quick Battle system sets up deliberate or randomized battles based on player specifications - Single player and head to head play, including Play By Email (PBEM) - Detailed and realistic combat formation for the United States Army and Syrian Army - Two types of Syrian Unconventional Forces, Spies, IEDs, and VIEDs - One large campaign, a small training campaign, 20 standalone scenarios, and numerous Quick Battle maps. - On map mortars, mortar vehicles, drones, anti-aircraft fire, and other modern warfare features - Expanded arid combat environment, now including waterways, bridges, and other new terrain - Intricately detailed and highly realistic combat equipment for the United States Army and Syrian Army, including 41 vehicles and 35 assorted small arms and crew weapons. - Expansive maps with 1m x 1m resolution allow for short and long range action across complex terrain - Buildings have explicitly simulated doors, windows, and floors - Weather and ground condition modelling systems allow for everything from dry sunny days to muddy stormy nights, with visibility and mobility dynamically affected by the conditions. Some Combat Mission games include the full range of Winter, Spring, and Fall weather as well - Line of Sight and Line of Fire are separately calculated, which means sometimes you can see something you can't shoot and sometimes you can shoot at things you can't see - Soldier posture (prone, kneeling, standing) affects everything including spotting, cover, and ability to engage enemies - Line of Sight is calculated from the 'eyeballs' or 'sensor' point, not a generic value - Much of Combat Mission's realism comes from correctly simulating important low level details, such as crew responsibilities, vehicle vision blocks, high tech sensors, etc. A 3 man tank with a few cloudy vision blocks doesn't have to be artificially made inferior to a 5 man tank with a commander's cupola and separate vision blocks for the gunner and loader because in Combat Mission it happens naturally - The way a nation organizes its units has a huge impact on how they perform in combat, therefore great pains are taken to accurately portray formations as they are in real life for a particular point in time - Lighting affects combat in no small way in real life as well as in the game. The correct lighting conditions are simulated based on time of day, time of year, and weather","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],"“I heartily recommend Shock Force 2 to any wargamer, newbie and grognard alike.” 4,5/5 – letstalkaboutwargames",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/header.jpg?t=1615392986,https://www.slitherine.com/steam,,support@slitherine.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,497,82,,0,424,,47336,0,47336,0,Battlefront,Slitherine Ltd.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,LAN PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Shared/Split Screen,Remote Play Together","Simulation,Strategy","Simulation,Strategy,RTS,Wargame,Turn-Based Strategy,Turn-Based Tactics,3D,Military,Alternate History,Historical,Tactical,Tanks,War,PvP,Artificial Intelligence,Turn-Based Combat,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Local Multiplayer,Combat","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/ss_69ca4a82413674e53996cb91ccb38e818f82bb7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615392986,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/ss_4ced8eea7a9060c8026f5db419c8b9444027e194.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615392986,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/ss_33cafd38a6055f598e232e1497b18ef1a1b31b0a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615392986,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/ss_53dcbee28207a04fe10e20a627b7993afe7ced30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615392986,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/ss_606e5f864ed09839466c8020e103a3e57eee5f7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615392986","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256799206/movie_max.mp4?t=1598879516,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256797628/movie_max.mp4?t=1598365500"

The mission: hire a band of mercenaries and take control of the deteriorating situation before the country finds itself in complete ruin. The story offers players an opportunity to experience three different viewpoints of the conflict or work out the political structure to achieve their own goals in the global domination. Game play for the title is based on an innovative combat system called SPMÂ® (Smart Pause Mode) that successfully blends together real-time and turn-based games. Unlike standard turn-based systems, Brigade E5: New Jagged Union does not use 'action points' while in turn-based mode, but takes into consideration the character skills and attributes resulting in more natural and diverse behavior of units. Furthermore players can issue a chain of commands that will be carried out automatically. The choice of weapons will satisfy even highly demanding fans, with more than 100 accurately modeled firearms, varied ammunition types, grenades, body armor and special equipment. Players will be also able to modify and upgrade weapons by adding various gadgets, sniper scopes, mini grenade launchers, bayonets, etc. The game provides extensive LAN and Internet Multiplayer modes, with CTF, Deathmatch and Fortress dynamic gameplay. SPM® is a brand new feature for the squad combat strategy genre. It gives all players a chance to command their soldiers at the same time, using even an enemy's pause.","['English', 'Russian', 'German']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/header.jpg?t=1656589575,,,support@1cpublishing.eu,True,False,False,41,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brigade-e5-new-jagged-union?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,73,34,,0,0,,42773,0,42773,0,Apeiron,Fulqrum Publishing,"Single-player,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Strategy","Strategy,Simulation,Tactical,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_760c140c3477700a0acd97a47a473a227e0780f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_2f570c60a0cdfcfa00287e5b0ce69a36793075fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_105379d9a6075dfe0f4a4ab7bcffee2306a25793.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_f9f7eaa147f168f5025f32cd873e259a9715e7cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_cccf7f74a11e3952e27d0438b7a8cb6c4db165b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_c4542d2d7bcbad89c30e9cc77f82da359e2e9b77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_aee2ec23acb555636c8187d373e98c98f4e683d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_8b787e87772530c88311e5082990a871cac3a730.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/ss_febce981c06d946dacae7cb94cc43f96e4d65274.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589575",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2032157/movie_max.mp4?t=1447361695

In the near future, humans will face the drastic consequences of climate change. Forced to take refuge in vital reserves using cryo-preservation, they await a second chance.

1477830,HudSight - custom crosshair overlay,"Jan 5, 2021",50000 - 100000,620,0,6.99,0,"HudSight tool draws your custom crosshair directly in a game screen. Our software uses overlay rendering technique which works both in full screen exclusive and windowed modes. Everyone knows that a game running in the full screen mode gets better performance and lowest possible input lag. But there is a problem with common 'on top' overlay tools. They cannot work in this full screen mode. HudSight can do it. Set one of pre-installed crosshairs or select your own image and that's all! Run a game and software will do the rest of work - your image will be automatically centered on the game screen. HudSight supports games based on DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12, OpenGL and Vulkan graphics. 32 and 64-bits games are welcome. It works on Windows 7, 8 and 10. Games compatibility Some games don't allow 3rd party overlays. For example, Destiny 2 or Forza Horizon 4. Some games allow overlays but with limitations, as example - CSGO which must be started with -allow_third_party_software key in the command line Anti-cheats compatibility HudSight works in the same manner as most of recording/streaming tools. This tool is not a cheat, it doesn't change games files or game play, it just draws an overlay (like Steam service). You only need to be sure that the Terms of Service of a game you play do not deny such enhancement.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/header.jpg?t=1620746309,https://hudsight.com,https://hudsight.com,,True,False,False,0,,0,1131,125,,8,1157,,20297,7072,26156,7626,Eduard Kozadaev,Eduard Kozadaev,,"Education,Software Training,Utilities,Video Production","Utilities,Education,Software Training,Video Production","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/ss_25eb3b8c9cd85fddcd3a9da8d1bc1c40bb98fc9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620746309,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/ss_4fcdf2eae595704505423970af913da0842cdde4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620746309,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/ss_a86c76a03d84f070634c5266b3d880f597101721.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620746309,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/ss_62dca5872754a2b0e15e65f21acee25f43ad11e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620746309,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/ss_a2529e192a3bd355d52539ea62ed9a135bbf4cf6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620746309",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256812909/movie_max.mp4?t=1608008626
1068820,OVR Toolkit,"Jun 28, 2019",200000 - 500000,1268,0,11.99,0,"** Please read this section before purchasing! ** - OVR Toolkit *only* supports Windows 10 and 11! Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported! - OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account. - Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!) Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase! Overview OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type. Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease! OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip) Features Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.) Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you. Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you. Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world. Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!) Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them. Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click. Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!) Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage. Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch! Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings! Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly! Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too) Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification. Customization Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI. Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI. Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications. Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!) Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made. Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode 'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game! (This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!) Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected. Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input. Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.) Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games. Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack) Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected. Important stuff you should know about We've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works! Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing: OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you) OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10) Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki! Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard) Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games! We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!) Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix! Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020) If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll whip up a hotfix ASAP!","['English', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Czech', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Portuguese', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/header.jpg?t=1643053241,,http://wiki.ovrtoolkit.co.uk,curtis@ovrtoolkit.co.uk,True,False,False,0,,0,1704,211,,0,1793,,20260,1692,20018,2431,Curtis English,Curtis English,"Steam Workshop,Partial Controller Support",Utilities,"Utilities,VR,Software,VR Only","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_e9a19b4f46c33237dadc307945f4921d4c74bd3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_bf9b9f335e13005b11bf2ad7187d0b2a08448038.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_240ae12aae9e273246b8c66044515e14ac9d6484.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_1d7fc6e64802c20e1c9563ea7e7113dfd2d56849.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_18f62e5be1e592a445f19aacceaf649b75edb1d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_c7e30bfa7f57d2308ee65345040b96a8f87dac16.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_92615fa4c9bc4a107b65f3e84a36e5c37c6e874a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_318617847b18170caefc3f5f10830756a802fa25.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_3c0ca86a0f44ad053d65e5508fc8f1151077ea58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_e82f2930dd93487b6c5810cfd42096b3fdc98a5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/ss_36853d9fb518bab6b40c2e3f2f45c7e782b841e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643053241",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256776673/movie_max.mp4?t=1583030160

384300,CPUCores :: Maximize Your FPS,"Jul 6, 2015",500000 - 1000000,355,0,14.99,3,"CPUCores is a cutting-edge Windows based software built by gamers, specifically for gamers, with 1 thing in mind: INCREASE YOUR FPS! CPUCores does this by micromanaging your Windows OS and non-essential applications to delivery maximum CPU to your game! 1) DIRECT STEAM INTEGRATION CPUCores automatically detects all of your Steam games. 2) OS OPTIMIZATION To start, CPUCores will isolate your entire OS to your first core. Secondly, CPUCores examines and constrains key Windows services that are not essential and known to hog CPU resources. Third, CPUCores examines and isolate key Windows processes to ensure a perfect balance of CPU savings without starving key Windows processes. 3) GAME OPTIMIZATION CPUCores will isolate and dedicate processing cores to be exclusively used by your game. CPUCores will allow game-specific hyper-thread disabling/enabling. 4) BACKGROUND / NON-GAME OPTIMIZATIONS CPUCores examines what non-OS and non-game operations your PC is running. It will do things such as constrain non-game programs to your first processing core. 5) EXTRAS Ability to 'START RANDOM GAME' with 1 button click! Fully supporting VR games! Support for non-Steam games Support for general, non-game applications like video editing, graphic design and more! Convenient game sorting options makes large Steam libraries manageable Incredible community surrounding the software! Direct contact with the developer for suggestions on feature updates! The impact of how CPUCores will help with FPS depends on essentially 2 things: #1 Your PC Hardware #2 The game itself Here are some benchmarks we've recently seen from our test system: ARMA III - 17.5% FPS Increase! Team Fortress 2 - 58% FPS Increase! TombRaider - 6.3% FPS Increase Left4Dead2 - 14% FPS Increase The CPUCores application identifies dozens of Windows programs, background processes, and non-gaming applications, and immediately controls and isolates them to a subsection of your total CPU resources. CPUCores will then free up a block of CPU resources and dedicated it specifically for a game. You can then launch a Steam game, or any game/program, directly via the CPUCores application. This enables CPUCores to control the processor usage for that game/program and ensure it has dedicated usage to processing cores. Your game no longer has to share resources with the OS / other applications.

719890,Beasts of Bermuda,"Dec 21, 2018",200000 - 500000,1794,0,19.99,0,"Beasts of Bermuda is a multiplayer game hosting large servers in which the player is a dinosaur or other prehistoric creature. A player can take the role of flyers, swimmers, herbivores, carnivores, and semi-aquatic creatures that fulfill different niches in the ecosystem. No matter what the player chooses to be, the objective of the game is to survive and grow up on the islands of Bermuda by using their particular creature's abilities. Predation from other players as well as intense environmental events are the antagonistic forces in the game the player must survive against. There are currently three game modes in Beasts of Bermuda. The first is our Life Cycle mode of gameplay. The player selects a creature of choice and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species. They must survive and gradually grow larger over time. As growth accumulates, they also earn talents, which can be spent to enhance different aspects of your creature's capabilities. The second is Free Roam, which allows the player to instantly spawn as an adult with a fixed number of talent points. Death has little consequence, as there are no growth mechanics, or other mechanics that reward the player for staying alive. The third game mode is Combat. This mode pits players against one another with small maps, close spawns, and mechanics designed to reward conflict. The player can accrue more talent points by killing other players and stealing their points.","['English', 'German', 'Russian', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Finnish', 'Hungarian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Ukrainian', 'Swedish', 'Danish', 'Turkish', 'Romanian', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Bulgarian', 'Dutch', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Traditional Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/header.jpg?t=1652434628,http://beastsofbermuda.com,,beastsofbermuda@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,4107,1521,,0,4850,,17147,1055,25096,1055,"Sastrei Studios, LLC","Sastrei Studios, LLC","Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP","Adventure,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,Simulation,Early Access","Simulation,Dinosaurs,Massively Multiplayer,Survival,Adventure,Indie,Open World,Multiplayer,Early Access,PvP,Realistic,Sandbox,Third Person,Horror","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_723fa9fa063ac5ffb051a8b16c1947c321f8b845.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_eb929407af0e5e0e0f617fab77f48a8dd20f5937.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_bbc5c151b4f62ee6341a45fc9b78019e32d0dd7b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_b66bebf76c4c9ad178775edceb6caf270bc8d776.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_70027363fae690e9dc34df47ee0e4cd576c2a3be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_abee54ba1ae27777d4841875cfc45f9d8ae02c2f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_70a92dffa1ccffec39b085c85cff390823dbc939.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_32bfd86ef0b95eb942198be9b361200ec62240f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_ae3def5d97624f3935a6bc7833b873d25d8e5712.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/ss_3447722a316d3d923f90236744ad581a6cbe7f17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652434628",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256738989/movie_max.mp4?t=1545330286

In Football Manager 2021 , dynamic, true-to-life management experiences and next-level detail renews that focus on you, the manager, equipping you with all the tools you need to achieve elite status. With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It’s over to you, boss. Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club’s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs… or face the consequences. Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There’s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team… Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points. Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch. Interaction Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are. Matchday Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You’ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before. FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there’s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third. Additionally, you’ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Analysis and Stats Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team’s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there’s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch. Recruitment New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club’s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you’ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club. End of Season Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before.

He would need some help from you and he invites you to Australia. You start your journey somewhere in a small town in Australia, where the only way to get recognised if you are able to build the fastest and best racing car around. You have Charlie, his expertise and his garage. The rest is up to you! You have to think as a real Revhead! You can buy or sell cars and components, fix and tweak your car to make it the fastest around. However, a good race car is not always about the fastest or strongest, but the one which matching with it’s driver. Set your car the way it fits for your driving skills and racing conditions. Revhead is about to build and race with your dream car and while all of your racing skills will be required to beat others on a track, you also have to master mechanical skills to be able to fix, maintain or re-build your car. A real car is built up from thousands of components. Each connected to each-others and they are working together as a car. In this game, every car is built up from dozens of individual components, connected to each-other the same way as in reality. Each component can be removed, replaced and swapped between other cars. This way, you can not only customise your paint work and outlook, but the handling and performance of the car as well. Understand your car! Watch your car when driving, how is it handling, how smoky is it or what noise coming from the hood. All these can help you to identify the real problem. You need a 4x4 but you don’t have the budget? Buy a wreck cheap car and transfer it to a 4x4 supercharged racing beast, using wrecked cars and used components from the newspaper. You engine is strong, but your car don’t reach the speed you want it to? Make sure your gears and differential also match with your goals! Racing and what is behind it In the reality, racing is about 80% mechanical work, 19% testing and 1% racing. In this game, we try to get closer to this, while we still wanted to keep the fun. If you like cars, if you do understand that a car is not only about 4 wheels, 1 motor and a steering wheel, if you don’t afraid of mistakes, if you dare to challenge others, even when you are with your most loved car, then Welcome in Noordu, the land of Revheads!","['English', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Hungarian', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian', 'Romanian', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Dutch', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","['English', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Hungarian', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian', 'Romanian', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Dutch', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","“Revhead - beaucoup plus intéressant qu'il n'y paraissait au premier abord.

Master Melvor’s many RuneScape-style skills with just a click or a tap. Melvor Idle is a feature-rich, idle/incremental game combining a distinctly familiar feel with a fresh gameplay experience. Maxing 20+ skills has never been more zen. Whether you’re a RuneScape newbie, a hardened veteran, or simply someone looking for a deep but accessible adventure that easily fits around a busy lifestyle, Melvor is an addictive idle experience unlike any other. Every skill in this game serves a purpose, interacting with the others in interesting ways. This means all the hard work you put into one skill will in turn benefit others. What strategy will you conjure to achieve maximum skillage? It doesn’t just end with Woodcutting, Smithing, Cooking and Farming either – take your finely honed tapping abilities into battle and face off against 100+ monsters using your Melee, Ranged and Magic skills. Conquering brutal dungeons and toppling boisterous bosses has never been quite like this before… In addition to over 20 skills to level up, there’s offline progression, cloud save compatibility, an integrated Bank/Inventory system and more! And thanks to its regular updates, the adventure continues to grow all the time. Do you have what it takes to conquer Melvor? Features include: A RuneScape-inspired experience suitable for veterans and newcomers alike. In-depth and endless Combat system featuring 8 dedicated Skills, countless dungeons, bosses to vanquish and lore to unearth. Deep but accessible systems featuring 15 non-Combat Skills to train, all with individual mechanics and interactions. Fully featured and interactive Bank/Inventory System.

The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing. Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks. Special access content requires Rockstar Games Social Club account.

1345870,Franchise Hockey Manager 7,"Dec 16, 2020",0 - 20000,45,0,19.99,0,"The Franchise Hockey Manager series returns for the 2020-21 season with plenty of new additions to the deepest, most authentic hockey strategy gaming experience you can find. Choose one of dozens of leagues around the world and select a team to guide to glory, including a chance at the ultimate prize: FHM7 is licensed by the NHL®, allowing you to take the reins of your favorite franchise to capture the Stanley Cup®. Take control of a national team and try for international supremacy. Choose a historical game, where you can begin in any year in NHL® history right back to the beginning in 1917. Or if you'd like to create your own customized league, you can do that as well! However you choose to play, you have control of your team and can oversee finances, select strategies, hire your staff, make trades, sign free agents, and draft the newest generation of stars as you try to build a championship team - and then make it into a dynasty! FHM7: Live Every Moment. All new for Franchise Hockey Manager 7: 2D Game Engine: Our game simulation has been rebuilt from the ground up, and now shows games in a top-down, fully-animated view that lets you see every second of the action! Historical International Tournaments: International games have been added to historical play, so you can control a team in legendary events like the 1972 Summit Series and the Miracle on Ice in 1980. We've also added a large number of non-NHL players to the historical database, so if you want to see what the cold war-era NHL would've looked like with the stars of the Soviet bloc added, that's now possible. More Customization for Custom Leagues: We've made the custom league setup much more flexible - you can now add as many leagues as you want, all of them fully customizable. The playoff editor also has a new custom configuration option in addition to the pre-set default systems. Redesigned Scouting System: The scouting interface has been simplified and made a little more visually appealing with the addition of maps showing the coverage your team (and individual scouts) have. Scouting reports have also been changed to provide more useful and relevant information, and Scouting Levels now include an estimate of the player's likelihood of reaching his potential. Reworked Draft Screen: Mock drafts, a draft review, and scout recommendations have been added. Additionally, we've moved the draft dates in modern and custom games - they now occur in early July, as they do in historical, which allows expansion teams to participate in them during their first season. Configurable Historical Evolution: When when you opt to turn on historical editing, you can now specify if you want changes like league foundings/closures, team expansion and deactivation, and rule changes to continue as they did historically or not, in any configuration you want. More Farm Team Control: If you want more control over your farm team, you can now have direct control over their depth charts and staff hiring. Schedule Editing: A long-requested feature, schedules can now be exported for editing, and then re-imported. Waiver and Intraleague Drafts: The beloved Waiver Draft has been added to historical play in the years it existed, along with its predecessor, the Intraleague Draft. Additionally, both are also available as options that can be activated for any other type of league. And that's only the beginning! Other significant changes and additions include: Reworked the news screen to show more headlines and flag personal messages and those which need a reply. Real-life full-career stats are now included on the player screens in historical mode, so you can see if a player is matching his real performance...or cheat a little, if you want to see how a potential draft pick really turns out. A team search tab has been added to the player and staff search. Various international upgrades: national teams run by the user no longer clear rosters after tournaments end, so you don't need to rebuild them, international staff histories are now recorded, and we've made various UI improvements and fixes to get the international screens working a little better. The continue button now alerts to you to upcoming events like drafts and trade deadlines. Database improvements like significantly expanded international stats histories for players, award histories for most leagues, and more The success of a national team now has an effect on the quality of new players generated by that country. Players can now be designated as Untouchable if you don't want to get trade offers for them, and players on other teams can be flagged as 'Not Interested' if you don't want them to be included in trade offers to you. The Aging attribute had been split into Aging and a new attribute, Development Rate to make our modelling of player career arcs more flexible. Roster AI has received a number of adjustments, mainly in the area of how the AI determines player value; most of these are designed to take advantage of systems (line chemistry, etc.) that didn't exist when the last major roster AI revision was done. AI teams' free agent-signing behaviour has also been improved. The player search screen's filter now allows minimum ratings scores to be included in the filter criteria.-We've made some database and player generation changes to significantly reduce the memory usage of long-term leagues, allowing much better long-term game performance for users with limited RAM. Many new things are editable on the player, team, and league screens - contract settings, favourites, foreign player restrictions, among others. Boxscores can now be exported as csv files. The later years of historical player data got a lot of re-work, fixing some inaccuracies and significantly adding to the number of post-2010 players who haven't made the NHL yet In addition to all of that, there are the usual large variety of smaller and internal changes, tweaks, database changes, interface improvements, and the 20-21 team and player updates!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/header.jpg?t=1633690466,https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/franchise-hockey-manager-home/,https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/franchise-hockey-manager/support.php,support@ootpdevelopments.com,True,True,False,0,,0,191,56,,133,233,,13618,1,13618,1,"Out of the Park Developments,Minos Games",Out of the Park Developments,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop","Simulation,Sports,Strategy","Strategy,Sports,Hockey,Simulation,Management,2D,Singleplayer,Tactical,Text-Based,Choices Matter,Trading","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_38788b2c41c679bf0abd48b92c00551c6986a8c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_88e7a1a783cb4b26f34c32f0e467ecd1d4daae4b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_6ff9509ad21db0c9afafaf224afdd0e86321adc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_47a4c3f01938aa69a7afab2c69afd613d76b0d19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_7b87b5e5a8c7abf184c8d5cc2cf53d593cedda6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_60e44c61fc95ce0b8197966b68fa330f5d83fcf9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_fab08832c263ccea816258cbd9797b4b3dc32053.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_78fb3603143c2ddd93ced853a103dd7288728341.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_2ce55645ecfbc5887662af3fee33826b9d2d8f7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_73f680baef27f1f3e5a892a360d172601b1bd716.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_9f95b17722f88cc9e9b8f0cdc140b2db5457ab72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_a39fb4dee80130c81250b9eabfdf959b410f4862.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_7b4e13fc4efa7da868f64992141f581bb285bce9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_5774d41c91657cad77a2922566aeef7878cb978e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_5b99edab54bfaaf74b6c20bcb51217b6243361e0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_1a65887de63c69ce662d3d4030b96665019b112c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_7d6cfddd4ee247e877bfbe62267016c6b9e187dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_676723b42908f4b145e0bb5cc9e25672afce210c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_eb8db3846fcbda014280a4fd8315f3c945492ccd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_ceb676b002bc9fbe76b0a65f7f042eb7f095b70f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_c0e41f7379584b84d46a132067eb071deb84591c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_6a6140e920051c336b745c572ad5c188636832c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_91aacbf9efc2b5c6a0633960195b55d1ec210b7b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_ad8b6a7efb719cffba514d5424ef93a71bb1a705.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_16d84d7c0d6b72f33a41f8a7fd0d6de8ed347f5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/ss_8a5e4f6b3af4dff6da66e2da25cdd44abe7abeb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633690466",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811684/movie_max.mp4?t=1606963743

In this city built upon the ideal coexistence of civilization and the environment, Tennouji Kotarou spends his days with his friends, Kanbe Kotori and Yoshino Haruhiko. In this peaceful city, a tumultuous event shakes the foundations of Kazamatsuri once a year. The Harvest Festival. Within this immense scale event, Kotarou collects all sorts of information. There are always rumors about unidentified creatures and the occult. At the same time, mysterious happenings keep befalling Kotarou. He takes up the offer to help Senri Akane, the club president of the Occult Research Society and begins an investigation that will end up involving his fellow classmates. To Kotarou, this created a lively and adventurous feel. To be able to spend time with this energetic and boisterous group was just right for him. But there's something Kotarou doesn’t know. He has yet to learn that his adventure is connected to a journey towards the “truth” that no one else has discovered. -Is it possible to rewrite fate?

594570,Total War: WARHAMMER II,"Sep 28, 2017",5000000 - 10000000,19068,0,59.99,22,"DEFEND YOUR WORLD. DESTROY THEIRS. Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria.

This classic grand strategy game gives you control of a nation through four dramatic centuries. Rule your land and dominate the world with unparalleled freedom, depth and historical accuracy. Write a new history of the world and build an empire for the ages. Start before the Renaissance on a map of the world as it was then. Choose from any of hundreds of nations and then rule up to the Age of Revolutions. Or, if you wish, start your game at any date in the span, with historical monarchs and other leaders. Hundreds of dynamic historical events are yours to experience, from merely troubling civil wars to world changing moments like the Protestant Reformation. Discover and settle the New World, or resist European conquest. Control the flow of trade by developing your trade power in key provinces, using ships and governmental policy to bring the wealth of the world to your own ports. Build alliances into iron bonds, cemented by royal marriage or play a flexible hand, keeping your options open. Strike when your enemies are weak, using your armies to grab new land and new potential riches. Your nation’s pace of development will be heavily influenced by the person on the throne. Experience rapid development under a skilled monarch only to see things slow down when a less competent heir takes over. Plan for the future by spending monarch power wisely. Four hundred years of research into new ways of war, administration and trade are available. Unlock new weapons, new buildings and new ship types.

Take on the role of a hunter and slay ferocious monsters in a living, breathing ecosystem where you can use the landscape and its diverse inhabitants to get the upper hand. Hunt alone or in co-op with up to three other players, and use materials collected from fallen foes to craft new gear and take on even bigger, badder beasts! INTRODUCTION Overview Battle gigantic monsters in epic locales. As a hunter, you'll take on quests to hunt monsters in a variety of habitats. Take down these monsters and receive materials that you can use to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt even more dangerous monsters. In Monster Hunter: World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at your disposal to hunt monsters in a new world teeming with surprises and excitement. Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined. ECOSYSTEM A World That Breathes Life There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries. HUNTING A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World. The Hunter's Arsenal There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter's disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways. Specialized Tools Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time.

346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,"Aug 27, 2017",10000000 - 20000000,98215,0,29.99,15,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

294100,RimWorld,"Oct 17, 2018",2000000 - 5000000,26495,0,34.99,5,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community . Read more at .

Play The World's Game with 17,000+ players, over 700 teams in 90+ stadiums, and more than 30 leagues from all over the globe. GAME MODES VOLTA FOOTBALL — For the first time on Steam, FIFA 21 presents: VOLTA FOOTBALL, a game mode that strips football back to its core. Experience the soul of the streets together with friends as you create your Avatar with the freshest gear and show off your style in over 20 football playgrounds around the world throughout various forms of small-sided football. We created VOLTA SQUADS so you can experience a more social street football experience, joining together with up to 3 friends or dropping into the community with other VOLTA FOOTBALL players. FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) — Join the most popular mode in FIFA, where you can build your dream squad of players past and present. For the first time, we’ve introduced FUT Co-Op, a new way to team up with a friend online and compete for rewards. Join forces in both Division Rivals and Squad Battles to earn weekly progress, and work towards brand new Co-Op Objectives that reward playing together beyond winning on the pitch. Choose sights, seats, sounds, and more as you build your dream stadium. Pack the seats, pick some epic Tifos, and grow your home ground on the way to the global stage. Career Mode — Manage every moment in FIFA 21 Career Mode with new additions that create more depth in matches, transfers, and training. Manage your team in licensed versions of the world’s biggest competitions — including the UEFA Champions League, CONMEBOL Libertadores, Premier League, LaLiga Santander, and Bundesliga — as you take your team to the top. House Rules — House Rules are back in FIFA 21. The premise of House Rules is simple. You can play matches that follow a different set of rules or even no rules at all. This creates space to have fun in between your serious matches. It's also a good way to introduce friends and new players to FIFA 21, allowing them to get comfortable with The World’s Game. With exciting play modes like Survival and No Rules, there is something for everybody to play. When playing FIFA 21 on Steam, you can use your DUALSHOCK 4 and Xbox controllers to play your way. This game includes optional in-game purchases of virtual currency that can be used to acquire a random selection of virtual in-game items.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Arabic', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Dutch', 'Korean']","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Arabic', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Dutch', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/header.jpg?t=1655996418,https://www.ea.com/games/fifa,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,0,,0,43290,13629,,36,40240,,9780,547,5488,547,EA Canada,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,In-App Purchases","Simulation,Sports","Sports,Soccer,Football,Multiplayer,PvP,Competitive,Controller,e-sports,Simulation,Local Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Online Co-Op,Realistic,Local Co-Op,Co-op,Modern,Casual,Runner,Great Soundtrack,Souls-like","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_c6f176d9fbba24dbb11807d2b2cb766822845165.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_958191b7f25fc43d19d0d2dd83267d9f916dc3a4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_921f04067be80e43dfb49571eadde3de4f0e9424.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_f70949e66edf5733b6824fc3dbd4de1bc8d99a76.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_6012c6b167ec471d316e939bc1ac1d97b438f293.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_ba1b9ff43d000918f1c2940d9c273a164290b304.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_e8f630eba722830d77ee317d3a2d8aa600195dd4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_96536f7f906bda0ba2fdce530a4d9a25646c85f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_d69a3f9e19bbb90f09e4eef86c5f686c7edbb82e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_b2a2b1328797182e97473fa3efc5ba7d07008128.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1313860/ss_e63b91b06749ae80eefa77ba660b1a09293a41b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655996418","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256812004/movie_max.mp4?t=1607098771,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256799397/movie_max.mp4?t=1598964946,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256799398/movie_max.mp4?t=1598964956,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256799399/movie_max.mp4?t=1598964965,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256794220/movie_max.mp4?t=1596207939"

There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected. Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake. Meet Others Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one. Survive Chernarus The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more. Loot Up Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask. Take your Shot Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Jun 14, 2016",10000000 - 20000000,46073,17,7.99,34,"Death Is Not an Escape. Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog. WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

903950,Last Oasis,"Mar 26, 2020",500000 - 1000000,249,0,29.99,1,"Last Oasis is a Nomadic Survival MMO . Earth has stopped rotating, and the last human survivors need to outrun the scorching Sun in a massive Open World . Traverse the world on your walker: a wooden, wind-powered machine inspired by Theo Jansen’s amazing strandbeests. Walkers are mobile bases that can be adapted for travel, transportation, harvesting, and combat. Personalize your walker to fit your needs with a multitude of structures, attachments, and upgrades! The sun burns the land in the west, turning it to dust. In order to stay ahead of the obliterating sun, nomads must explore new territories that slowly emerge on the eastern horizon, where the Earth has long been frozen in impenetrable ice. After a cataclysmic event halted the Earth’s rotation, the planet was split into two extreme and deadly environments. Only a narrow region between the burning and freezing halves of the planet can support life. This region moves as the planet orbits around the sun, and all living creatures must migrate with it to survive. In order to keep moving, the remnants of humanity have built nomadic machines, and a walking city called the Flotilla. Survive by exploiting what’s left of the world: find a source of water, hunt ferocious creatures, fend off pirates, brew mind-bending Vitamins, and uncover hidden walker technologies. Build autonomous machines to harness the power of the wind. Claw your way from a ragged nomadic trader to the heights of a mercenary king, fleet commander, or a legendarily-rich merchant. There are trade networks that stretch between the discovered oases. In this global, player-driven economy, smart and quick traders can take advantage of supply and demand to make huge profits. Other nomads may opt to produce or hunt down rare and highly localized resources. It’s always wise to consider potential competitors first, though. Threaten another clan’s operation, and you may become their next target. The large, open world is made up of many interconnected oases that are over 100km2 each. Potentially thousands of oases exist simultaneously – the number automatically adjusts to accommodate the size of the playerbase. Explore them to reveal new and unique biomes while plundering their limited resources. Some nomads may pitstop to refill their water. Others will settle for some time, but ultimately everyone will pick up and voyage east to escape the encroaching sun. The Wasteland is a safe, open stretch of desert that sits between the last livable oases on Earth. It can be used to travel to adjacent oases, or as a place to hide your walker and safely log off with all your belongings. Last Oasis features dynamic, skill-based directional melee combat. Nomads can choose their weapon from a wide range of both one and two-handed swords, maces, axes, and quarterstaves. If you prefer ranged combat, you can customize your walker with weapons like ballistas, scattershot guns, repeaters, or even giant slingshots. Specialize in one or become a more versatile fighter by trying to master them all. Construct portable bases or more permanent fortifications to protect yourself from hostile nomads and wildlife. Stone walls offer superior defense, while lighter wooden structures are able to be packed on large walkers and relocated. Individuals and small groups of players have as many opportunities as clans to prosper. Clans might control territories and lead the economy, but cunning traders, skilled mercenaries, agile hunters and pirates will find niches that better suit solo play. While solo play will always be a viable playstyle, social features like voice chat make it easy to meet new friends and team up to kill some of the largest creatures. Grow your clan into a political and economic power. Control a region and get rewarded with a supply of local resources gathered there by roaming nomads. Make alliances to protect your income, because war is always around the corner. Enemy clans will challenge your control and threaten to take away everything you’ve built. Master the vertical movement. Every Nomad owns a grappling hook; it’s a tool that can be adapted to almost any playstyle. It’s all about your skill: some struggle to climb the smallest rocks, while others swing through forests outspeeding the fastest Walkers. Dubbed ' The Long Ones ', these roaming creatures are the biggest threats nomads will face. The worms are ravenous. Once the beast focuses on a walker, it loses sight of everything else.

392160,X4: Foundations,"Nov 30, 2018",500000 - 1000000,2423,0,49.99,8,"X4: Foundations is the latest title in the popular X series of space simulation / sandbox games , played as action games from a first-person perspective in a living breathing universe, with TRADE FIGHT BUILD THINK as the common tag-line. X4: Foundations is unique in its depth, simulating an entire universe of NPC ships and stations, forming a realistic economy . It consists of a huge universe, simulated from the bottom up. Hundreds of stations, and thousands of ships, trade goods among themselves. Prices change based on supply and demand; resources are mined and processed in several stages. This economy is linked directly to the simulation of major conflicts in a universe with dynamically-acting factions. Every player decision can dramatically change the future of the game universe. Step in and live your very own space adventure! X4: Foundations has been significantly enlarged with its 5.00 Update – this is the perfect time for space game enthusiasts to newly discover or revisit the biggest space sandbox this side of the galaxy! The 5.00 update introduces a series of new capital ships. These ships have been re-imagined, and a new fleet of improved models will now be on sale in various shipyards. Several factions in the game will gradually start using these new and improved ships. Start your journey In X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction . Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide. Fly every ship X4 allows you to fly all ships personally . From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships . You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair. Build space stations and upgrade your ships Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale . In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative . Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship. Experience the most dynamic X universe ever X4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires ; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe . Manage your empire with a powerful map Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions. Dive into the most detailed X economy ever One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy . Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources . Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy. Research and teleport The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation . Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Russian', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Polish']","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Russian', 'Polish']","“If you’re the sort of person that loves that sensation of exploration in a sandbox, and just doing everything that comes to you as you find them all, this will be a game you can sink hundreds or even thousands of hours into.” -x4-foundations-2/ “An ambitious, complex sandbox space game that allows you to do almost anything from spacewalking to commanding a carrier with a fleet of ships onboard.” -foundations-review/ “X4: Foundations is more of the same niche-scratching space exploration from previous iterations with a more immersive feel and I can’t wait to dive back into my personal galaxy.” -x4-foundations/",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/header.jpg?t=1651672910,https://www.x4foundations.com,https://www.egosoft.com/support/index_en.php,info@egosoft.com,True,False,True,0,,0,10638,3375,,105,11712,,8429,0,1579,0,Egosoft,Egosoft,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud","Action,Simulation,Strategy","Space,Simulation,Sandbox,Open World,Space Sim,Sci-fi,Economy,Action,Singleplayer,Exploration,Strategy,Flight,Building,Trading,Management,Crafting,Immersive Sim,First-Person,Lore-Rich,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_48add58f1778ff64a88fc0dc5c8b665c0cecff89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_5e5f311ea693b673f62cf416ceecc826ca602cbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_ff11e93404276dd98d5159c19a30041ab3b3dcfb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_92ce0e228a374d33b1c27564c35ddca77e7b5705.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_90856a621c6a44d184695f9edc81ca93a5d09a27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_a8ad176e9247f18818191a156ecfb4a4ef9d320e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_c97cc60f60fd72c114d785b861656979b8ef200a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_186574627878c6a596b60fa614639bdfe6155ddf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_9d444d2a52c738c96d913d8e8b297af8aec168e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_1781119fd8a684acb2b14f4a9e397c6d5822856e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_179ae2441aff59439795fc5d75ade0115a15cf6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_73f434cac1f1b12cdba020860f98d2fb8746bbc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_3ca3287f38212fd902eff500dcc4540b4d39d66b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_fe8fe0ec12bd385664a0198d0772badcdd5fd086.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_59903fd12a6894b5f6fc94f3bf68d3139e5c0a58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_d932e14da41164ff4b85e31314c365b8b01daf6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_da2bdbf28c40488164f581458b978a38e431f3ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392160/ss_9d87c8e83778d41fca411243090eea8325ecd9c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651672910","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256826095/movie_max.mp4?t=1615914251,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256876978/movie_max.mp4?t=1646750426,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256826115/movie_max.mp4?t=1615914260,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256729946/movie_max.mp4?t=1538387691,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256729923/movie_max.mp4?t=1538387683"

Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective. Backbone: Prologue is the first act of a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. Backbone’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. As Howard, you will: • Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth • Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be • Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver • Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss • Be a raccoon Post-noir dystopia Backbone’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and existentialist world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better. Stunning visuals The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling city to life.

Go in guns blazing and attract the attention of everything, living and dead. Take a subtle approach sneaking around and making use of distractions. Confront and learn to counter special abilities ranging from invisibility to fire breathing to lightning attacks. STRUGGLE AGAINST NATURE Zombies aside nature does plenty to make life hard. Forage wild fruits and vegetables. Hunt animals for pelts and meat, or in some hostile environments become the prey. Fish for food and garbage. Plant a crop and make sure it gets rain. Seek warmth and take shelter from blizzards. DEAL WITH OTHER PLAYERS Friend or foe there's a lot of interesting people online. Arrest bandits with handcuffs and blindfold them as a non-lethal strategy. Fight with every kind of weapon under the sun - swords, machine guns, snipers, missiles, landmines - you name it. Raid enemy encampments using charges and detonators and steal their loot. For pure PvP play arena mode in a last man standing battle to the death, or PvE for peaceful cooperation. Roleplay servers encourage everyone to stay in character and tell a story together. HELP THE NEW SOCIETY Plenty to do even if you're offline or going solo. Meet, talk and trade with NPCs. Complete quests to aid NPCs and progress the story. Fend off waves of the undead to clear hordes. Secure airdropped supplies. Gear up with gasmasks to scout radioactive deadzones. FORTIFY YOUR STRONGHOLD Somewhere to kick back and chillax or a hideout to direct your gang, whatever floats your boat (in this case sometimes literally). Build with barricades, furniture, traps, machinery and more. Board up the windows of existing structures to survive the night. Craft an entirely new structure from supplies you collect. Turn your vehicle into a moving fortress by building on it. TRAVEL BY LAND, AIR AND SEA Roll out in style with a fully stocked garage. Land vehicles including tanks, quads and snowmobiles. Air vehicles from helicopters to seaplanes to fighter jets. Sea vehicles such as jetskis and hovercraft. Maintain your vehicles with tires, batteries and fuel. EXPLORE MASSIVE WORLDS With 5 officially developed and 1 curated community created sandbox map there's a wide variety of locations to discover: Prince Edward Island (PEI) The Yukon Washington Russia Hawaii Germany MOD EVERYTHING From the ground up Unturned was designed for modding. Download player created content ranging from guns to vehicles to huge levels from the workshop, and upload your own. Build custom maps using the in-game level editor. All of the official maps were created with the same free public tools and their assets are open for you to use. Write plugins using built-in or strong third party systems. Get your apparel and skins upvoted in the workshop for consideration to be accepted and sold. Team up with other modders and put together your own update for consideration to be officially adopted. NEAT STUFF I think these features are neat and they didn't fit anywhere else. There's many more I want to include but for brevity's sake: Most objects can be destroyed to create new pathways.

491950,Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You,"Oct 27, 2016",1000000 - 2000000,28,17,9.99,1,"Big Brother has arrived - and it’s you. Investigate the lives of citizens to find those responsible for a series of terror attacks. Information from the internet, personal communications and private files are all accessible to you. But, be warned, the information you supply will have consequences… Orwell is a new governmental security program that has the power to survey the online presence of every person in The Nation. It can monitor all personal communications and access any computer. To preserve the privacy of citizens, human researchers examine the data Orwell finds and decide which pieces of information should be passed on to the security forces, and which should be rejected. Selected from thousands of candidates, you are Orwell’s first human researcher. And when a terror attack rocks the Nation’s capital city of Bonton, Orwell, and you, are immediately put to the test. Starting with a single person of interest, you'll help the security forces build out and profile a network of potential culprits. But are these people really terrorists? What does the information you reveal to Orwell say about them? What if you find out things about them that not even their loved ones know? What is the real price of maintaining the security that the Nation is yearning for? Key Features Investigate the digital lives of citizens. Search web pages, scour through social media posts, dating site profiles, news articles and blogs to find those responsible for a series of terror attacks. Invade the private lives of suspects. Listen in on chat communications, read personal emails, hack PCs, pull medical files, make connections. Find the information you need to know. Determine the relevance of information.

1379930,Power & Revolution 2020 Edition,"Sep 17, 2020",20000 - 50000,37,0,49.99,6,"In Power &amp; Revolution 2020 Edition, play as the Head of State and extend your influence around the globe. By playing as several countries, try to change the destiny of our planet with orchestrated actions. Play as the head of the legal or illegal opposition and seize power! With the new scenarios in Power &amp; Revolution 2020 Edition, try to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and revive economic activity, participate in the 2020 US presidential election or engage in lightning wars to add conquered territory. STRATEGY, SIMULATION AND MANAGEMENT Power &amp; Revolution 2020, is a simulation of our current world, recreating its features in-depth and across a number of domains: economic, political, military, social, financial, environmental, energetic, transportation... All countries of the world are represented with their own features. The calculation and scenario engines include more than 100,000 data, 15,000 texts and 10 hours of recorded dialogue. A detailed and animated 3D world map helps to support the players, with all the borders, regions and important and strategic locations of the world The game combines management stages of economics, commerce, wargames, construction, espionage, simulation, and political influence and manipulation. Players can opt for the management of just one country or several simultaneously and design collaborative strategies to change the world's destiny. There are game settings across multiple domains: degree of activity of terrorist organizations, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of populations, outbreak of wars. More than twenty contextual scenarios with current events from today's world are integrated. 2020: A TURBULENT YEAR! As the year 2020 begins, the Covid-19 is spreading... As the head of one or several nations, take up the greatest challenge of the human race since the Second World War as you try to contain this health crisis and its economic impact. This game also offers multiple scenarios: a simulation of the world without the Covid-19 pandemic, a glimpse of a future with the emergence of an even more dangerous virus, participation in the 2020 US presidential election, the transformation of the player’s political system into an absolute monarchy, and various ongoing conflicts which showcase the new wargame functions (formation of squads, missile silos, anti-aircraft batteries...). A TOTALLY UNIQUE SIMULATION ENGINE The game engine, Geopolitical Simulator 4, includes over 600 data elements for each of the 175 playable countries and calculates their changes in real time throughout the game based on players’ actions. Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Power &amp; Revolution simulator for education and training. Over one thousand playable actions. At the country’s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more. Propose bills to be voted on in Parliament, for example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc. The player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more. SIMULATIONS OF MAJOR GLOBAL THREATS The Geopolitical Simulator 2020 Edition simulates all the major perils that threaten the planet and produces a comprehensive assessment for each one from the results along with specific graphics. The list of threats is substantial and many of them are interconnected: global warming, the widening of social inequality, the risk of global atomic war, overpopulation, unemployment, atmospheric pollution, terrorism, cybercrime, regional conflicts, food insecurity, world hunger, deforestation, natural disasters (storms, floods, drought, extreme heat...), rising sea levels, ocean acidity, disappearance of animal species, climate refugees, epidemics, endocrine-disrupting chemicals… PLAY AS THE OPPOSITION At the head of a legal or illegal organization, the player can take power by force, revolution, diplomacy, or democratic election. To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates… AI CONTROLLED LOBBYISTS AND CHARACTERS All actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...). To prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 10 hours of dialogue in the game). REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASES The world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups... As a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts. City battles are shown on precise maps with all the major buildings and intersections. The players, according to the side they represent, can direct police, hooligans, military personnel or armed extremists to these locations and construct barricades, send in snipers, loot the banks, or have armoured vehicles move in. SECRET SERVICES Secret services play an important role. They have an arsenal of espionage and \'special\'' operations: reveal scandals about an opposing political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage foreign infrastructure, assassinate an opponent, send reconnaissance drones or position satellites to locate enemy units, etc. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS International organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council’s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization. INCLUDES MULTIPLE OPTIONS • Game operating as single-player with a multi-country mode allowing play with several countries simultaneously • Game settings: terrorist activities, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of the populations, outbreak of war • Player ranking online and in real time • Incorporation of your own photos, logos, names to make the game even more realistic • Interactive tutorial and game help available at all times during the game (in beginner mode) • Learn about geopolitics by playing the QUIZZ mode, including more than 3000 questions • Enjoy different configurations with double screen or 4K screen offering a customized interface • Avec l'extension Modding Tool, (add-on prochainement en vente sur ce site), vous aurez la possibilité de créer et de partager vos propres scénarios et contextes géopolitiques ou bien de télécharger ceux des autres utilisateurs • With the Modding Tool extension (add-on soon available for purchase on this site), you'll be able to create and share your own geopolitical scenarios and contexts or even download those of other users • Text and dialog 100% in English NEW CONTENT FOR 2020 Simulation of the Covid-19 Pandemic... Based on actual data, the pandemic is recreated and the player can follow its progress with various graphs, stats and maps and is kept up to date directly by their Health Director. Numerous tools and legislation are at your disposal to try and slow the spread of the virus: managing inventory and distribution policies (masks for professionals and the general public, screening tests, treatments, ICU beds), construction of temporary hospitals, an arsenal of lockdown measures (for the population, for schools, businesses, bars and restaurants), limiting gatherings and travel, regulating transportation, closing the borders, use of tracking software, transfer of patients and vaccine research. All of these measures can be customized by region and their level of contamination, the objective being to stem the pandemic as quickly as possible and to slow its progress to limit the impact on the economy. ...and the Economic Crisis Depending on the situation, the player can impose, or lift, restrictions on businesses. In response to the decline in business, various measures can be put into place: partial unemployment, aid for the poor or support for struggling economic sectors to minimize unemployment and the decline in growth. The debt and deficit of a country can be strongly affected by this crisis and if, in the short term, the State can rely on international lenders, especially when a member of the European Union, then the player will have to return to more acceptable levels in the long term so as not to alarm financial markets. Other Scenarios In 'The World Without Covid', the player can lead their country in a 'normal' context, without the pandemic. In the 'SARS-CoV-3 Mutation' scenario, set in 2022, when, after a widespread vaccination of the world population for Covid-19, researchers discover a new patient carrying a virus that seems to resistant to the vaccine. Has the virus mutated? The pandemic crisis plunges the world into turmoil: in the 'Coronation' scenario, the player can take advantage of the chaos to install a royalty and become an absolute monarch. Wargames Scenarios and Functions A number of units and functions have been added: anti-missile and anti-aircraft batteries which can be deployed to concealed locations to intercept aerial attacks, intercontinental missile silos and anti-aircraft silos that are difficult to destroy and can launch missiles at a very long distance, formation of squads which allows the movement of units as a whole to be able to attack as one or to defend each other, area bombing from cruisers that targets multiple enemy units in a single run, forming groups of satellites or drones to cover a larger area, the addition of anti-missile armaments for carriers and certain cruisers, the addition of a 'Fog of War' mode, concealing stationary missile launchers and reinforcing the defense of military bases. A special mini-guide describes the function of all military units in detail. Numerous lightning war scenarios reflecting the geopolitical context of potential conflicts in which large nations claim foreign territory. The player can choose to play as the aggressor, attempting to annex enemy territory within a certain amount of time; as the defender, fighting back while the international community mobilizes and forces the invaders to retreat (China vs. Taiwan, Russia vs. Georgia, Turkey vs. Libya...) 2020 US Elections Choose your Republican or Democratic candidate and launch your campaign to become the next president of the United States.

939600,LOVE³ -Love Cube-,"Jul 25, 2019",100000 - 200000,11,0,9.99,2,"This is Steam version . ◆Overview A visual novel depicting the protagonist living with three women. Centers around 'bashful face is the cutiest thing'. Fully animated with Live2D. IshiKei's illustrations will come to life and bounce up and down! Support multiple languages. Two languages can be displayed simultaneously. ◆Story Things are looking grim for down-on-his-luck adult comics artist, Ichinari Tsuzurigi. He's struggling to even afford his meager rent, and is seriously considering giving up on his dream, until... His editor, Akira Higashibojo, who's always looking out for him, offers him a position as an assistant to one of the top dogs in the adult comics industry! Thinking of it as a last hurrah, Ichinari accepts. Lo and behold, said top dog turns out to be none other than Ichinari's childhood friend, Iori Shitaka, with whom he made a childhood promise to become manga artists together. Also working as an assistant is dojinshi artist of the moment Nodoka Amabane. Ichinari was her Senpai in manga club during high school, and taught her how to draw. Shocked but elated at this unexpected reunion, they discover that a certain god has taken an interest in their wishes and blessed them with interconnecting 'Fates' that will forever change the course of their life. And so Ichinari finds himself working on sexy manga while living with a group of women whose burgeoning feelings can't be ignored... ◆Staff Planning/Production: Sayori Illustration: IshiKei SD Illustration: Sayori Plot: Yukihito Music: POPHOLIC ◆Characters Iori Shitaka CV：Momo Hayama 'A childhood friend that may look like the calm and collected type, but in reality she's easy to make blush.' Ultra-popular and one of the most famous adult manga artists in the industry. As childhood friends, she and Ichinari made a promise to pursue their dreams to become manga artists. She continued to work her hardest, with that promise and those feelings in the back of her mind, and before she knew it...she was drawing erotic manga?! Still, believing that if she continues drawing manga she'll one day be reunited with Ichinari, she pours her heart and soul into her porn. Sometimes she worries about the number of pairs of panties she gets through when she's working alone... Nodoka Amabane CV：Chacha Warabi 'A sweet yet sexy vixen on the outside, but inside she's pure, innocent (?) and hopelessly devoted to her Senpai.' A manga artist in one of the most popular dojinshi circles in the fan comics world. Ichinari was her Senpai and the only other member in their high school's manga club. He graduated before she could work up the courage to confess her feelings to him, but she's kept drawing manga to this day in the hope that she would meet him again. She was always a diamond in the rough, but she's now polished up nicely. Her path to drawing dojin was opened up to her by a scene in a magical girl anime where the heroine was tormented by the enemy, and behind her sweet outward appearance lies hidden - and kinky - depths! Akira Higashibojo CV：Mei Hanazono 'This powerful woman isn't to be trifled with, but as Ichinari's Onee-chan she tends to let him get away with almost anything.' Ichinari and Iori's editor. Being super into judo, she's never afraid to be blunt and get straight to the point. Ichinari was her first client, and she soon found herself falling for him. She's got that big sister vibe to her and, although she can come down on him harshly, mostly she's putty in Ichinari's hands. Her company never refund her expenses, and she's always crying about her meager salary and terrible working conditions.","['English', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese']",['Japanese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/939600/header.jpg?t=1581656039,,,support@amanita.co.jp,True,False,False,0,,0,2192,121,,26,2178,All character depicted are over the age of 18.

376210,The Isle,"Dec 1, 2015",1000000 - 2000000,6578,0,19.99,0,"The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. Survival or Sandbox? The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge. A Global Community Story The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline. Future Development Goals We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: Playable aquatic and aerial creatures Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous Evolve into advanced 'strain' versions of certain dinosaurs Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours Additional world biome types such as thick jungles Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system Global in-game world quest Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text Better accessibility &amp; customization options Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes Mod support using Steam Workshop All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received-- --End Promotional Protocol-- --SiGnaL InTeRrUpt-- -tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev -",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/header.jpg?t=1653237914,https://survivetheisle.com,http://survivetheisle.com,support@findtheisle.com,True,False,False,0,,0,44556,9061,,0,49541,,7241,238,1932,341,Afterthought LLC,Afterthought LLC,"Multi-player,MMO,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","Action,Adventure,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,Simulation,Early Access","Dinosaurs,Survival,Open World,Multiplayer,Simulation,Hunting,Massively Multiplayer,Realistic,Adventure,Early Access,Action,Third Person,Co-op,Sandbox,Walking Simulator,Indie,Horror,Strategy,Team-Based,RPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_6cd28dd53eafdc554e5ce34f8a16dcc5b98108a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_8d63cb38072130b757b20c230b0c8acb5277c111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_afcf388e9e0db1392670fa01d935a9f81967be3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_24b6c83804afa270e658ef5b234f4b6edd6bef07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_868033a862fd428cce7fbd476fd0cc8e3b747ae8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_621af6de335a68d0fc50c89154b31664cd682646.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_adc8573f459c7db0720079504ee65049f74302dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_86a537b7ec72eda17fe2c32e51c11512623dfee9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_33d76fde3b16046a457f75b0813572a7e948a10b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_37fc8f90654e67ea2130dd82282a9439319493ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_12ee4ee37c7d8d2026bb84ef1f7ba5002917a945.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/ss_b2b27b7017219659be182fbe486cfbb073b67e4a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653237914",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256700115/movie_max.mp4?t=1509733590

Dive down a rabbit hoIe as you follow the instructions of a recently deceased hacker, whose death may not have been the accident the media reports. Using old school command prompts and real hacking processes, you’ll solve the mystery with minimal hand-holding and a rich world full of secrets to explore. Bit, a hacker responsible for creating the most invasive security system on the planet, is dead. When he fails to reconnect to his system for 14 days, his failsafe kicks in, sending instructions in automated emails to a lone user. As that user, it’s up to you to unravel the mystery and ensure that Hacknet-OS doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Exploring the volatile nature of personal privacy, the prevalence of corporate greed, and the hidden powers of hackers on the internet, Hacknet delivers a true hacking simulation, while offering a support system that allows total beginners get a grasp of the real-world applications and commands found throughout the game. Features Real Hacking Based on actual UNIX commands, Hacknet focuses on real hacking, not the Hollywood-style version of it. This creates a truly immersive experience and puts players right in the thick of trying to break through the firewalls. Unlock the mystery of Bit A hacker is dead and the media reports don’t add up. When you are contacted by his “ghost” - an automated failsafe system - you’re drawn into the dark and murky world of underground hackers. Full immersion You are thrust into a persistent virtual world with no “levels” or obvious game elements to break the illusion. Follow the guidance of the emails from Bit or just dive down the rabbit hole, chasing down clues and snippets of information you find as you explore different systems. Accessible but uncompromising Whilst not holding your hand or dumbing down, the design of the game and the learning curve enables those with no prior terminal experience to enjoy it whilst delighting those in the know. Killer tunes Hack to the beat of a soundtrack featuring underground artists including Carpenter Brut (Hotline Miami) and Remi Gallego (AKA The Algorithm). Soundtrack produced in association with The Otherworld Agency.

383730,RPG Maker 2000,"Jul 13, 2015",20000 - 50000,7,0,24.99,0,"For the first time, RPG Maker 2000 is available in English! Since its debut 15 years ago, the beloved game-making engine has introduced untold amounts of users to the wonders of game design and continues to be a powerful, user-friendly tool. No other engine in the RPG Maker series comes closer to the classic late-80s/early-90s feel, with graphics and a battle system that hit the nostalgic sweet spot while still offering huge opportunities for innovation. With a brand new translation and updates, this is the best version of the classic engine you’re going to find! Key Features: -Classic Front-View Battle System: Recalling the earliest days of the console RPG, this vintage layout hasn’t lost its thrill. Creating fights can be learned in minutes but there is major potential for surprising, dynamic battles once all the different conditions and events are mastered. -Straightforward, User-Friendly Interface: RPG Maker engines are designed to be as flexible as possible while still being user friendly, and RPG Maker 2000 is one of the earliest examples. Virtually everything in the engine is managed through a simple point-and-click interface. All of your game’s characters, enemies, skills, animations, and equipment are created and stored in an easy-to-navigate database. An in-depth event system contains dozens of functions to help make your story and world come to life, such as custom messages, character movement, player choices, special effects, and more. Plus, RPG Maker 2000’s powerful map editor is extremely easy to master, allowing you to craft your world tile by tile with unprecedented efficiency! -Retro Aesthetic and Huge Customization : RPG Maker 2000 allows you to create games that look just like ones from the storied history of console RPGs. However, the possibilities go far beyond the graphics that come with the engine. If you’re feeling especially creative, RPG Maker 2000 allows you to import custom 16-bit graphics, including character sprites, tilesets for your environments, battle animations, backgrounds, and more! The engine is also loaded with a variety of catchy midi tracks and sound effects for your game; custom WAV and MIDI tracks can be added as well. -Share Your Game : Want to share your creation with the world? You can export your creation in a portable file that can be played on ANY Windows system! Plus, games made with RPG Maker 2003 can be sold as long as you have the appropriate rights and have followed the registration procedure. With some hard work you could become the next great indie game developer!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/header.jpg?t=1630988774,,http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/support,,True,False,False,0,,0,96,11,,0,0,,6611,0,13218,0,"Gotcha Gotcha Games,KADOKAWA,Yoji Ojima",Degica,,Web Publishing,"Game Development,Web Publishing,JRPG,RPGMaker,RPG,Anime,Software","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_90bd8539d276e8fcdf01dec0ed6e13f3c17d5a3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_a13a3632ed8027772bb06a5482bbc4062de4a97e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_c65670a156c17d8a79a2fe44caee977bdae40c17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_477b6ebd7a574ad113e8e6c97cdd81a44442c4ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_d93805159fc52f300b973381c2e4379ab4759f30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_b09f929cc2fb756c18c43cbabb41342510ae9513.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_4d0f12683f023dac912efa8bf67d7f6d4306ad78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_730c2eff4d498cae3bda5d037793fa224d7209e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_e8c73f39ed3bc64fe64ab8145639c5930f0e20c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_90bd8539d276e8fcdf01dec0ed6e13f3c17d5a3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_a13a3632ed8027772bb06a5482bbc4062de4a97e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_c65670a156c17d8a79a2fe44caee977bdae40c17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_477b6ebd7a574ad113e8e6c97cdd81a44442c4ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_d93805159fc52f300b973381c2e4379ab4759f30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_b09f929cc2fb756c18c43cbabb41342510ae9513.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_4d0f12683f023dac912efa8bf67d7f6d4306ad78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_730c2eff4d498cae3bda5d037793fa224d7209e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_e8c73f39ed3bc64fe64ab8145639c5930f0e20c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1630988774",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040798/movie_max.mp4?t=1447377104

784150,Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic,"Mar 15, 2019",200000 - 500000,1435,0,34.99,2,"Manage all aspects of your own republic with planned economy, including mining resources, manufacturing goods, construction, investments, and citizens too. Create your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories. Build the infrastructure and manage its traffic , including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections. Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops. Send your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods. Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings. Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles , as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's. Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live. Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play –one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources. Increasing difficulty. As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work. TRANSPORTATION You have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time. RESOURCES &amp; INDUSTRY There are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them. Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses. WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDS Every worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time – cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc. Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements. ECONOMY SIMULATION The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction. You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper. As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Italian', 'Czech', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Romanian', 'Hungarian']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/header.jpg?t=1652709822,http://sovietrepublic.net,https://www.sovietrepublic.net/support,,True,False,False,0,,0,10272,1070,,0,10806,,6536,563,9269,563,3Division,3Division,"Single-player,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","City Builder,Economy,Strategy,Simulation,Building,Management,Early Access,Political Sim,Trains,Indie,Cold War,Politics,Transportation,Political,Historical,Realistic,Choices Matter,Singleplayer,Multiple Endings,Story Rich","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_7fc8a4df1d020c2245f510cdd05897ee08565980.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_b0956768592b79f3b5375124aa7e7b19a3edb2dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_2f686d5b9f566a4253542bfe8321fc856997bd75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_83ce2c1679b03523b8b3f123d143e8ed5f803291.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_c5dc8d2a62c930278f630c28fe65c225a075ac23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_8f0df2ee89be6332621c1eaa195f781cadee187f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_141303487178b4628804180716f17ef79b01b8ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_b24600f473c7645cee7871408a1fa4173c0381e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_24754c56920d4476f660a28e8b92cf381a5fa7da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_a89cdc4300f30d248eeaf299cc87f2dcdb0c91a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_64d3b82ce49ec46c1466b944ee9f5e1f5bfb60f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_d11b916e0b476dd98dde8c40bd8ac0b47f4f0fec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_f4e562754f330a8fa0bf759534df4cbdc5ddbaac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/784150/ss_4f310c5d5ed5b5a1f8fbcb9be53d0f7874ec006b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652709822","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256745027/movie_max.mp4?t=1552341499,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256835982/movie_max.mp4?t=1621945553,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256835872/movie_max.mp4?t=1621945560"
682130,Discord Bot Maker,"Aug 21, 2017",200000 - 500000,158,0,9.99,0,"Discord Bot Maker is a powerful bot development tool for the #1 text and voice chat service for gamers: Discord. With this tool, you and your teammates can take your social experience to the next level! Explanation One of the most prominent features provided by Discord is the official support for bot accounts. In a matter of 20 seconds, anyone can receive an official bot account in order to enhance the experience for members of their chat server. However, up until this point, manipulating a bot would require significant amounts of programming experience. It's time for that to change. Discord Bot Maker is powerful, yet flexible, tool that allows both experienced programmers and bot newcomers to construct outstandingly effective bots in a matter of seconds. By piecing together actions that may occur through commands or events, one may create the bot of their dreams! Features Discord Bot Maker uses a system based on 'commands' and 'events'. Commands are manually called functions that invoke specific actions. These are done by sending specific words or phrases into the chat. The other half of the system involves 'events'. These will invoke functions based on certain conditions, such as members leaving/joining the server, the creation of channels, the banning of members, etc. Both commands and events call upon 'actions' that the developer selects. Here's a sample of some of the supported actions: Sending Messages Generating Embedded Messages Creating Roles and Channels Sending Local Files Dynamically Editing Images Manipulating Emojis Storing and Controlling Data Applying Logic Sequencing Banning or Kicking Members Being Awesome And much more! Not to mention, Discord Bot Maker provides a modifiable action system. Using HTML and JavaScript, advanced users can create their own actions by designing custom UIs and programming specific features. One may even manipulate bot code through extensions.

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.","['English',

872410,ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV,"Jan 15, 2020",200000 - 500000,3447,0,59.99,39,"Triumph over the land, take charge of the fate of China! Conquer territories and fly your colors! A struggle for land where new strategies are born: from points to planes! The vast land of China is represented a single realistic map, with the characteristics of the land replicated beautifully in CG. The vast map is comprised of 46 cities and approximately 340 regions. The regions are collections of detailed territories, and the struggle for land is intuitively expressed through a color scheme. Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely. New strategies created by supply lines and maintaining the front line When troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players’ forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front. Administration changes completely by doctrine and a unique policy! Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy. More than 150 “characters” and over 1,000 officers – the most in the series! More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a “character” (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on. Some officers possess a powerful and unique character, and arranging the right officer in the right place will help in shortening the path to conquering territories. Note: The 'ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack Bundle', which is a set that includes the combined content of 'ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV' and the 'ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack' is also available for purchase.

The year is 1895, and you are a Hunter tasked with eliminating the savage, nightmarish monsters that have infested the Louisiana Bayou. Play alone or in teams of two or three, as you search for clues to help you track your target and compete against other Hunters who are after the same reward. Kill and banish your target, collect the bounty, and then get ready for the showdown; once the bounty is in your hands every other Hunter on the map will be after your prize. Show no mercy as you fight through a dark, ruthless world with brutal, period-inspired weapons, as you level up, unlock gear, and collect experience and gold for your Bloodline. HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD, HIGH-TENSION GAMEPLAY Competitive, match-based gameplay combines PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense PvEvP experience where your character and your gear are always on the line. Succeed, and you will be rewarded handsomely but remember – a single mistake could cost you your Hunter – and any gear they were carrying. BOUNTY HUNT MODE Team up or go it alone to battle monsters, bosses, and other Hunters to secure the bounty in Bounty Hunt, the game’s main PvPvE mode. Play alone or in teams of two or three with up to 12 players on the map Use Dark Sight to collect clues and track your target Fight brutal creatures and deadly monsters – and the other Hunters who are competing for the same prize Be the first to find and take out the target and collect your reward Get to an extraction point without being killed by those who seek to steal the bounty Live to die another day QUICK PLAY MODE In this shorter mode, solo players compete to be the last Hunter standing. Play solo in a shorter match format against up to 12 other solo players Scavenge for gear Be the first to find and close four rifts in a competition for a diminishing pool of bounty Close the last rift and absorb all its energy -OR- compete to eliminate the leading Hunter to steal their reward Survive the final countdown to complete the mission Last Hunter standing keeps their Hunter - while the others perish, and are lost TRIALS AND TRAINING MODE Prepare for the thrill of the hunt in the game’s Trials and Training modes. These provide a pure PvE experience for honing your skills and maximizing your chances of taking home the bounty. Explore any map without the pressure of a Hunter ambush Sharpen your skills and practice you kills Complete Trial objectives testing your speed, strength, and sniping skills Walk in the shoes of the notorious Hunters who came before you SPECIAL FEATURES: PROGRESSION &amp; DARK SIGHT Progress through the ranks via your Bloodline, which allows you to level up your Hunters. Though a Hunter may die, some experience will always be transferred to your Bloodline, which over time unlocks new weapons and specializations for your other Hunters. Dark Sight allows Hunters to see the unseen by helping you to track clues with a ghostly light and marking players carrying a bounty.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Polish', 'Turkish', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","['English', 'Portuguese - Brazil']",“Hunt: Showdown - The best Multiplayer-Shooter 2019 so far” 89% – Gamestar “Crytek release their best game yet - and one of the most original multiplayer shooters ever” Excellent – Eurogamer “Hunt: Showdown offers one of the most strenuous multiplayer experiences I’ve ever had and I loved every second of it.” 8.5 Great – Dualshockers,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/header.jpg?t=1658736563,https://www.huntshowdown.com/,https://huntshowdown.kayako.com/,,True,False,False,81,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/hunt-showdown?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,111202,22833,,37,103792,,6074,701,898,380,Crytek,Crytek,"Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,In-App Purchases,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Open World,Atmospheric,Tactical,Perma Death,Difficult,FPS,Survival Horror,Shooter,PvP,Team-Based,Multiplayer,Battle Royale,Horror,Online Co-Op,Action,Western,Co-op,Gore,Zombies,First-Person","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_ecccaab1143081ca96d8bf00d8b1c4d3d3291e64.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_36f6d959f75d1cca48c2a98d892d2697f6d4bde6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_f2a2d3445a568c0748aca08a44f45ceac4810cb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_021db5b59b2108a69fa710164b97e58cfaada03c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_4697d48347130eaf48e03e92556252f6b8744428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_5d14f045ac48f8aa8ccd643a1db7e83a0c384fba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_96b76906c12136d782e755a4ee85235826ef40fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_0eb340c35e5765530907b9aa49f98b8fe5b47534.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594650/ss_73a09984fc936bd31349b540147fa85bd35cd84c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658736563","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256893785/movie_max.mp4?t=1656430960,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888313/movie_max.mp4?t=1653488271,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256879291/movie_max.mp4?t=1648207907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256823639/movie_max.mp4?t=1614179059,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256843177/movie_max.mp4?t=1648207911,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858124/movie_max.mp4?t=1635519844,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256783663/movie_max.mp4?t=1588176470,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760169/movie_max.mp4?t=1566909105"

805550,Assetto Corsa Competizione,"May 29, 2019",500000 - 1000000,3933,0,13.59,6,"Assetto Corsa Competizione is the new official GT World Challenge videogame. Thanks to the extraordinary quality of simulation, the game will allow you to experience the real atmosphere of the GT3 championship, competing against official drivers, teams, cars and circuits reproduced in-game with the highest level of accuracy ever achieved. Sprint, Endurance and Spa 24 Hours races will come to life with an incredible level of realism, in both single and multiplayer modes. Assetto Corsa Competizione will feature Blancpain GT Series’ 2018 and 2019 seasons. Assetto Corsa Competizione is born from KUNOS Simulazioni's long-term experience, and it takes full advantage of Unreal Engine 4 to ensure photorealistic weather conditions and graphics, night races, motion capture animations, reaching a new standard in terms of driving realism and immersion, thanks to its further improved tyre and aerodynamic models. Designed to innovate, Assetto Corsa Competizione will be set to promote eSports, bringing players at the heart of the GT World Challenge and putting them behind the wheel of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens and many other prestigious GT racing cars, all reproduced with outstanding level of detail. REALISTIC SIMULATION Assetto Corsa Competizione is designed to faithfully recreate the performance and the driving experience of real GT World Challenge cars through a sophisticated mathematical model that accurately replicates tyre grip, aerodynamic impact, engine parameters, suspensions and electronics systems that determine vehicle balance, as well as the influence of mechanical damage on the car's drivability. NEW-GENERATION GRAPHICS AND VISUAL EFFECTS Unreal Engine 4 guarantees photorealistic rendering and an accurate representation of scenarios, car materials and weather conditions. Thanks to the multi-channel audio sampling of real GT cars, the game conveys captivating and immersive acoustic surroundings and realistic environmental effects. CARE FOR DETAILS Even the secondary details are faithfully reproduced to make you feel the thrill of being in the cockpit of a real racing car. Doors, windshield wipers, headlights, racing lights, racing equipment and control devices such as ABS, traction control, engine ignition and ECU mapping, are all under the driver’s management to assure the best performance and offer the player total control of the car. THE MOST ACCURATE CIRCUITS Thanks to Laserscan technology, every official circuit is recreated with the utmost accuracy: all curbs and details perfectly fit their real counterparts to grant a gaming experience as faithful to reality as possible. ADVANCED MULTIPLAYER FUNCTIONALITY A well-structured ranking system will evaluate individual performance and driving behaviour to reward the most virtuous drivers and promote fair play in online competitions. The matchmaking function makes sure that you can compete with opponents of similar skill level and easily find online races to join, while the leaderboards will allow you to compare single-lap performance with drivers from all around the world with the same car, circuit and weather conditions. IMMERSIVE SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE Career, Championship and Free Play modes offer a complete and customizable gaming experience, also thanks to the tutorials and progressive aid levels that allow you to tailor AI opponent difficulty and vehicle stability control to your abilities. The Special Events will allow you to gain a first-hand experience of the most noteworthy real-life GT World Challenge. HIGH-LEVEL HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY Assetto Corsa Competizione ensures full compatibility with a wide range of peripherals from gamepads to professional steering wheels. MOTION CAPTURE FOR REALISTIC ANIMATIONS Motion capture technology is used to create the animations of mechanics and drivers in an even more realistic fashion, and guarantee a high level of player engagement during races, pit stops and driver changes. BLANCPAIN GT SERIES Encouraged by the success of the Blancpain Endurance Series, which after its creation in 2011 quickly became the global reference for GT racing, world-renowned Swiss watch manufacturer Blancpain and the SRO Motorsports Group decided at the end of 2013 to extend their partnership to the Blancpain Sprint Series. From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing. With both the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup now sharing the same driver categories and points system, the ten-round Blancpain GT Series season – comprising five sprint events and five endurance events – crowns the world’s most complete GT drivers. A Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup event consists of two races of one hour each, while the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup races range from three-hour events through a 1000 km race to the season highlight of the Total 24 Hours of Spa, one of the world’s leading 24-hour races.","['English', 'Italian', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']","“Assetto Corsa Competizione has an exceptional DNA: more than a driving game, it's a top-level simulator, developed by and for pro drivers.” 85 – Multiplayer “Features of Assetto Corsa Competizione?

In the first habitable planet they found, they noticed the world works different than the known universe. It is ruled by gods. Soon after, Hyperion, the first god found the humans and fought them. After a long lasting fight, all humans but you – the player – died. While surviving the whole time, you developed your own special ability: to create shadow clones. The game starts here. You create shadow clones, they train, learn skills and fight monsters for you, while you absorb their power until you are powerful enough to beat the first god “Hyperion”. After beating Hyperion, you find many, much stronger gods. To be able to defeat all of them, you must find various ways to become more powerful. You rebirth, create your own monuments, train pets and fight ultimate beings. You feel like doing nothing? Even though you want to become rich? You are lazy? But you want to be stronger?

727570,After the Collapse,"Oct 8, 2018",20000 - 50000,5,0,14.99,0,"After The Collapse is a base building game set in a post-apocalyptic world featuring urban environments . Your task is to manage a band of survivors and protect them against raiders, mutants and environmental threats. To do so, you'll have to build a base, discover new technologies, and scavenge for resources. The game's most unique features are the ability to manage very large bases with dozen of survivors , the ability to dig and build through several underground layers , and the interactive world map where you can launch expeditions, capture buildings, deal with other factions and complete quests. Thanks to its urban and semi-urban environments, After The Collapse has a strong focus on scavenging, repairing and reusing existing structures and technologies. You will send scouts to explore the ruined city, repair and maintain outposts while trading with other factions to survive. Contrary to many games in the same genre, After The Collapse, on top of being a base-builder, allows you to interact with the world outside of your own base. You can send expeditions to loot off-map buildings and to take control of production centers. Other factions have the same goals as you, and your paths will inevitably cross. You'll also come across special events and quests altering your experience. Implemented Features The following features are already implemented and may be expanded further during the development. Build a colony in hostile procedurally generated environments Dig several layers below ground, uncovering dangerous foes and lost technologies Manage bases with a population ranging from a few survivors to hundreds of them Multiple scenarios with specific challenges, goals and quests Launch expeditions to find more survivors, loot and technologies Battle other factions for the control of the area Rebuild production centers to maintain a steady supply of resources Defend against raiders and mutants with automated turrets, traps and other defensive structures Conduct diplomacy and trading with other factions Medical system handling wounds, diseases and mutations Use generators and solar panels to keep your advanced structures operational Defeat and tame dangerous creatures including fire breathing giant crabs Take prisoners and use them as a work force or as commodities Build your own customized robotic army Full Modding Support After the Collapse is a DRM-Free game with no hidden costs and, as with all our games, it will be actively developed and receive free content patches regularly. Your feedback is important to us, which is why we're releasing it in Early Access, so please pop in the community forums or the official discord to be part of the community. After The Collapse is a very easy game to mod.

It was definite as hell.” - Kelsey Kelsey has come back to a room packed up in boxes. She has one goal - get Marie’s journal. When she picks it up, the memories come back. Because twenty years ago Kelsey and Marie shared this room. They spent days in it working on projects, nights talking about boys, pizza and sparkly shoes.

427520,Factorio,"Aug 14, 2020",5000000 - 10000000,14796,0,30.0,1,"Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire. Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer , create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends. Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a range of interesting challenges in the form of Scenarios . If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor , place down entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.
